# EmojiDex: An Algolia-Powered Search

## Project Description

EmojiDex is a simple search proof-of-concept that is powered by [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/). This was part of I was originally inspired by the Pokemon Pokedex. EmojiDex uses Angolia to index a JSON file containing emoji data provided by https://github.com/amio/emoji.json and provides an interface to search emojis.

This project was generated with create-instantsearch-app by Algolia and was created as part of mintbean.io Agolia hackathon.

### Future Enhancements

* Currently, there is only one dataset indexed, thus, there is only one filter. I'd love to index additional datasets that will create additional filters as well as pages.
* Given the short amount of time in the hackathon, I'd love to dive deeper into Agolia's functionality and implement them in EmojiDex.
* As always, I'd love to continue to make a great user experience and continue to improve the design of the page.
